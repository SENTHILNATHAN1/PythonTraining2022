<< Difference between compiler and interpreter >>
S.No.	Compiler	Interpreter

1.	Compiler scans the whole program in one go.	
Translates program one statement at a time.

2.	As it scans the code in one go, the errors (if any) are shown at the end together.	

Considering it scans code one line at a time, errors are shown line by line.
3.	Main advantage of compilers is itâ€™s execution time.	

Due to interpreters being slow in executing the object code, it is preferred less.
4.	It converts the source code into object code.	

It does not convert source code into object code instead it scans it line by line
5	It does not require source code for later execution.	
It requires source code for later execution.

Eg.	C, C++, C# etc.	
Python, Ruby, Perl, SNOBOL, MATLAB, etc.

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

#Legal variable names:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

#Illegal variable names:
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
